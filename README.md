Title: Designing a Data Logger Circuit for Performance Monitoring Applications

This work is done during my visiting scholar program in the US at the University of Delaware. I had two mentors during this time at the University of Delaware, Prof. Fouad Kiamelev and Prof. Mark Mirotznik. For his collaborations with Prof. Fouad Kiamelev, I worked on a project entitled “Carbon Nanotube BASED Novel Flexible Sensors in Functional Fabrics for Performance Monitoring”. For this project, I mentored a PhD student that had been able to get promising data from the performance monitors that are used for biomedical applications and they require a data logging circuit that to be able to run their experiments on subjects. They already had a system, but is was too large and unsuitable to be placed on the subjects. Also, their system doesn't provide live data streaming to a laptop or mobile which doesn't allow live data monitoring during the experiments. I helped him to re-engineer the system to meet these two requirements  and this lead to more promising experimental results.

Details of the data logger are presented in this repository
