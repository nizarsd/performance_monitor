To connect the ESP8266 to arduino nano use the following connection 

	- Voltage divider is needed for the RX of the ESP since the Arduino talks 5.0V and the ESP talks 3.3V
	- I can connect and see wifi networks now
	- Connected to my iphone hotspot 

Next: try to connect to an AP and transfer data to mobile or pc

	For reliable communication ESP's baud rate must be set to 9600. This can be done by sending AT command as follows, EspSerial.write("AT+CIOBAUD=9600");

[08-03-2018] 
	ESP is configured as TCP server and python script telent client. I'm now sending data to python over wifi successively 
	Working scripts
		- wifi_send_data.ino
		- telnet_client.py

	- I'm now sending data to python as udp packets. This ADC shield is now added (ADS1115) and used to sense the photo resisitance voltage. 
	- The main issue is that it's much slower than the built in ADC on the Arduino nano (one order of magnitude slower). 
	- The ESP8266 baud rate is increased now to 38400  	
	Working scripts
		- UdpSendReceiveSensor_v2.ino (firmware)
		- socketRealTimePlotV2.py (data sink)

[08-16-2018]
	-  Conversion speed is improved by reducing ADS1115_CONVERSIONDELAY to (1) instead of (8) at [HOME]/sketchbook/libraries/Adafruit_ADS1X15/Adafruit_ADS1015.h
